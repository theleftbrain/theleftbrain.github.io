		<p class="post_text">The Left Brain is a progressive data analytics blog. It was created by Dominic Russel as an outlet to combine his loves for data visualization and progessive policy. It was also a way for him to get less bad at html. The idea is the product of conversations with the great Zach Lipp and the beautiful logo was created by the also great Madelyn Schorr. There is about a 50-50 chance there will ever be new posts.
